Final Project: Rectilinear Polygon Operations for Physical Design
=================================================================

* This problem is set by ICCAD in 2019, ICCAD's Contest Problem E in 2019.

* The detailed problem description is provided in "Problem-Rectilinear Polygon Operations for Physical Design.pdf", which could be * downloaded from "http://iccad-contest.org/2019/tw/problems.html"

* Compile the source codes by typing "make"

* Execute by typing "./myPolygon input_file output file"

* An example input and output is provided in "exampleinput.txt", "exampleoutput.txt" respectively. All the format follows ICCAD Contest.

Note: In this version, all the data structures and algorithms were designed by myself. Another version provided in another directory was done mostly by c++ boost library.
