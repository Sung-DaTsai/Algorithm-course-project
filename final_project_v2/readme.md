Final Project: Rectilinear Polygon Operations for Physical Design
=================================================================
V2: By boost library
--------------------
* This problem is ICCAD's Contest Problem E in 2019.

* The detailed problem description is provided in "Problem-Rectilinear Polygon Operations for Physical Design.pdf", which could be downloaded from "http://iccad-contest.org/2019/tw/problems.html"

* Compile the source codes by typing "make"

* Execute by typing "./myPolygon input_file output_file"

* An example input and output is provided in "exampleinput.txt", "exampleoutput.txt" respectively. All the format follows ICCAD Contest.

Note: In this version, I used boost library and it has better performance. Before compiling, c++ boost library must be downloaded. Another version provided in another directory didn't use boost library.
